# [Blackjack-Configurable]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackjack-configurable/id975037070?ls=1&mt=8)

It's a iOS app written in Swift. All graphics and animation for the game was done using the iOS UIKit framework. The game is integrated with [Apple's game center](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/).

It is a [Blackjack card game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) with configurable rules. You can practice blackjack strategy by easily setting rules applicable to any blackjack establishment. Plenty of configuration options are available.  

## Open Source

The app is completely free and open source.  You can check the [Github repo](https://github.com/sameertotey/BlackJack) to view all the source code. 

### Configuration options
I have spend great effort to ensure that all the Blackjack game rules are applied accurately. Since there are so many variations of the Blackjack game, I have created easy configuration settings to set the desired rules.

### Future plans

I plan to add more features to this game in the future releases, please stay tuned for updates. In the meanwhile, please read the various posts that explain the configuration options and how to play the game.
