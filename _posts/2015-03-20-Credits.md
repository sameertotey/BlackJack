This blog was constructed using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes.

I have adapted the styles from [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler. The overall concept of this blog is inspired from [Jekyll now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

The blog is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Various open source images are used for displaying cards.
